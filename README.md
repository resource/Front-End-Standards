##  Overview title (tbd)
Agency developers should:  
- Move quickly.  
- Collaborate.  
- Be consistent.  
- Write quality code.  

Following a style guide helps fulfill these requirements. When our code is cohesive it is easier to read and navigate; there is less friction in collaboration and innovation can flourish.

The purpose of our style guides is not to strictly enforce one way of writing code, but rather to provide a [mostly agreed-upon](https://github.com/resource/Front-End-Standards/issues?direction=desc&labels=&page=1&sort=updated&state=closed) approach. A project's developer lead or architect has the freedom to deviate from these standards when appropriate.

## Contributing
Resource is an [O.P.E.N.](http://www.resource.com/o-p-e-n/) agency and we strongly encourage collaboration and participation in the larger developer community. See our [open issues](https://github.com/resource/Front-End-Standards/issues?direction=desc&sort=updated&state=open) and participate in the conversation.

### Creating Issues

- Provide a descriptive title.
- Each issue should have at least two labels: 
  1. Issue type (Flaw, Enhancement, etc.)
  1. Document affected (JavaScript, CSS, etc.)

## About Resource
We were a digital marketing agency before they existed. Decades before the first tweet. Years before the first smartphone or digital commerce transaction. Our company was founded 30 years ago with Apple as our first client, 3 years before Mark Zuckerberg was even born. Digital thinking, digital marketing and digital experience innovation: It’s not just what we do. It’s in our DNA.
